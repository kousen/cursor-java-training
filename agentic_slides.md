- AI as helpful tool
- Task-focused interaction

</v-clicks>

</div>
<div>

## Agentic Development

<v-clicks>

- Developer defines high-level goals
- AI collaborates on planning and execution

# Agentic Coding Principles

<v-clicks>

## 1. Goal-Oriented
Define **what** you want, not **how** to do it
- ❌ "Add a for loop here"
- ✅ "Process all orders and update their status"

## 2. Iterative
Plan → Execute → Review → Refine
- Continuous improvement cycle
- AI learns from feedback

---

# Agentic Coding Principles (Continued)

## 3. Collaborative
AI as thinking partner, not just code generator
- Architectural discussions
- Design pattern suggestions
- Problem-solving partnership

## 4. Context-Aware
AI understands entire system, not just files
- Cross-module dependencies
- System-wide impact analysis
- Holistic understanding

</v-clicks>

---

# Extended Thinking Mode

## When AI Takes Time to Think

<v-clicks>

**What is Extended Thinking?**
- AI takes time to reason through complex problems
- Multi-step analysis and planning
- Deeper understanding before code generation
- Like having a senior developer think through architecture

**When to Use:**
- Architectural decisions
- Complex refactoring projects
- Performance optimization strategies
- Security analysis
- Legacy code modernization

**Demo:**
```
Extended Thinking: "Design a modular architecture for an e-commerce 
system with user management, product catalog, order processing, and 
payment handling. Consider maintainability, testability, and team 
collaboration."
```

</v-clicks>

---

# Demo: Extended Thinking in Action

**Complex Problem:**
```
Extended Thinking: "Analyze this monolithic e-commerce application 
and design a modular architecture that supports team collaboration, 
independent deployment, and maintainable code."
```

<v-clicks>

**AI Response Process:**
1. **Analysis Phase** - Understanding current structure
2. **Design Phase** - Identifying module boundaries
3. **Planning Phase** - Migration strategy
4. **Implementation Phase** - Step-by-step approach

**Key Insight:** AI considers factors you might miss:
- Team size and expertise
- Deployment constraints
- Testing strategies
- Future scalability

</v-clicks>

---

# Part 2: Plan Mode for Complex Changes

## Multi-Phase Project Execution

---

# What is Plan Mode?

<v-clicks>

## Core Concept
AI creates step-by-step implementation plans for complex changes
- Multi-file, multi-phase modifications
- Reviewable and modifiable plans
- Executable in phases
- Human oversight at each step

## When to Use Plan Mode
- Large refactoring projects
- Architecture migrations
- Feature additions across multiple modules
- Breaking changes that affect multiple components
- Team coordination on complex tasks

## Key Benefits
- **Visibility** - See the full scope before starting
- **Control** - Modify plans before execution
- **Safety** - Execute in phases with validation
- **Collaboration** - Share plans with team

</v-clicks>

---

# Demo: Planning Modular Refactoring

**Starting Point:** Monolithic e-commerce Spring Boot application

**Goal:** Refactor into modular architecture with clear boundaries

<v-clicks>

**Step 1: Analysis Phase**
```
Plan Mode: "Analyze this monolithic e-commerce application and create a 
plan to refactor it into modular architecture. Identify module boundaries, 
shared dependencies, and refactoring phases."
```

**Generated Plan Overview:**
- **Module Identification:** User, Product, Order, Payment, Common
- **Shared Library Extraction:** DTOs, utilities, configurations
- **Database Schema Separation:** Module-specific tables
- **API Contract Definitions:** Inter-module communication
- **Migration Phases:** 4 phases with dependencies

</v-clicks>

---

# Plan Review and Refinement

<v-clicks>

**Step 2: Plan Refinement**
```
Plan Mode: "Modify the plan to prioritize User module first, 
include local Docker services, and add comprehensive testing strategy."
```

**Refined Plan Features:**
- **Phase 1:** User module extraction
- **Phase 2:** Shared library creation
- **Phase 3:** Product module extraction
- **Phase 4:** Order and Payment modules
- **Phase 5:** Integration and testing
- **Phase 6:** Documentation and deployment

**Key Insight:** Plans are living documents that evolve with requirements

</v-clicks>

---

# Plan Execution: Phase 1

**Execute Plan Phase 1:**
```
Plan Mode: "Execute Phase 1: Extract User module from the monolith.
Create separate User module with its own package structure, 
entities, and API endpoints."
```

<v-clicks>

**Generated Changes:**
- New User module structure
- User entity and repository
- User API endpoints

SQL injection, XSS, authentication bypass, and data exposure risks."
```

```
/generate-tests: "Generate comprehensive unit and integration tests for 
this class using JUnit 5, Mockito, and TestContainers."
```

</v-clicks>

patterns: entity, repository, service, controller, and tests."
```

</v-clicks>

---

# Demo: Using Custom Commands

<v-clicks>

**Security Review:**
```
/review-security
```
→ AI analyzes User module for vulnerabilities

**Test Generation:**
```

"Create REST API for product management"
```

**Review:** "The API needs pagination, filtering, and proper error responses"

**Refinement:**
```
"Add pagination with page/size parameters, filtering by category/price, 
and structured error responses with proper HTTP status codes"
```

**Iteration:**
```
"Include OpenAPI documentation and validation examples"
```
