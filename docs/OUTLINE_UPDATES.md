# Outline Updates Summary

This document summarizes updates made to session outlines based on validation findings.

## Session 1 Outline Updates

### Changes Made

1. **Common Issues & Solutions Section:**
   - Added: "Gradle compatibility with Java 25+: Use Java 21 (recommended) or update Gradle wrapper to 8.10.2+"
   - Includes instructions for setting JAVA_HOME to Java 21
   - Notes option to update Gradle wrapper if using Java 25+

2. **Part 2: First REST Controller:**
   - Added note about Java version when running application
   - Fixed endpoint URL from `/greet` to `/api/greetings` (matches actual implementation)

3. **Pre-Session Materials:**
   - Added: "Java version verification (Java 17 or 21 recommended; Java 25+ may require Gradle wrapper update)"

### Rationale

During validation, we discovered that:
- Gradle wrapper in projects may not support Java 25+ out of the box
- Using Java 21 resolves compatibility issues
- Students need this information before they start

### Impact

- Instructors are now aware of potential Java version issues
- Common Issues section provides immediate troubleshooting guidance
- Pre-session checklist helps prevent issues before class starts

## Session 2 Outline

### Review Status: ✅ No Changes Needed

The Session 2 outline already:
- ✅ Clearly states "Android Studio installation required - not optional!"
- ✅ Emphasizes hybrid workflow throughout
- ✅ Includes comprehensive troubleshooting section
- ✅ Notes Compose preview limitations in Cursor
- ✅ Emphasizes switching between tools

The outline accurately reflects the Android development requirements.

## Sessions 3-5 Outlines

### Review Status: ✅ No Changes Needed

Based on instruction validation:
- ✅ All outlines accurately describe required features
- ✅ Prerequisites are clearly stated
- ✅ Technology choices are appropriate
- ✅ Session dependencies are noted

No updates needed as these sessions haven't been fully implemented yet.
