- ✅ Prompt effectiveness (structure review)
- ✅ Technology choices (Kotlin, Compose, Room, Hilt)
- ✅ Logical flow of exercises

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1. Use Android Studio to create TaskManagerApp project
2. Use Cursor Composer to generate code per lab instructions
3. Test in Android Studio/emulator
4. Document findings and update lab instructions as needed

### Lab Structure Review

**Lab 0:** Android Setup Verification (5 min)
- Clear instructions for Android Studio setup
- Good verification steps
- Proper Cursor integration guidance

**Lab 1:** Creating Task Manager Project (10 min)
