## Session 1 Slides (slides.md)

### Updates Made

1. **Project Setup Section (Step 1: Generate Project):**
   - Changed: "Java: 17 or 21" → "Java: 17 or 21 (21 recommended)"
   - Added: Note about Java 25+ requiring Gradle wrapper update

2. **Troubleshooting Appendix:**
   - Added new section: "Gradle compatibility with Java 25+"
   - Includes two solution options:
     - Use Java 21 (recommended)
     - Update Gradle wrapper to 8.10.2+

3. **Q&A Section:**
