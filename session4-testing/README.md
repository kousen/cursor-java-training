# Session 4: Testing Solutions

This directory will contain the solution implementation for Session 4 lab exercises.

## Project Structure

```
session4-testing/
├── README.md              # This file
└── ecommerce-testing/     # Testing suite solution
```

## Testing Project

This project demonstrates:
- AI-assisted test generation
- Unit testing strategies
- Integration testing with TestContainers
- End-to-end testing patterns
- Performance testing with JMeter
- Security testing with OWASP ZAP
- CI/CD integration with quality gates

## Prerequisites

- Session 3 completed (or equivalent e-commerce project)
- Java 17 or 21
- Spring Boot 3.2+
- TestContainers support
- Docker (for TestContainers)
- JMeter (optional, for performance testing)
- OWASP ZAP (optional, for security testing)

## How to Run

1. **Navigate to project:**
   ```bash
   cd ecommerce-testing
   ```

2. **Run all tests:**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew test
   ```

3. **Run integration tests:**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew integrationTest
   ```

4. **Generate test coverage:**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew jacocoTestReport
   open build/reports/jacoco/test/html/index.html
   ```

## Technologies Used

- JUnit 5
- AssertJ
- Mockito / MockK
- TestContainers (PostgreSQL, Redis)
- MockMvc
- WireMock (external service mocking)
- JMeter (performance testing)
- OWASP ZAP (security testing)
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD)

## Lab Exercises

This solution implements exercises from [Testing Lab Exercises](../testing_labs.md):

- ⏳ Lab 0: AI Testing Setup
- ⏳ Lab 1: Unit Test Generation
- ⏳ Lab 2: Integration Testing
- ⏳ Lab 3: End-to-End Testing
- ⏳ Lab 4: Performance Testing
- ⏳ Lab 5: Security Testing
- ⏳ Lab 6: CI/CD Integration
- ⏳ Lab 7: AI Debugging

## Session Dependencies

**Requires:**
- Session 3 e-commerce modular project
- OR a Spring Boot application to test

If Session 3 isn't available, you can use any Spring Boot project for testing practice.

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests:** Fast, isolated tests for services and controllers
2. **Integration Tests:** Database and service layer testing with TestContainers
3. **E2E Tests:** Full API workflow testing
4. **Performance Tests:** Load testing with JMeter
5. **Security Tests:** Vulnerability scanning with OWASP ZAP
6. **CI/CD:** Automated test execution in GitHub Actions

## AI Testing Features

This session emphasizes:
- AI test generation with comprehensive coverage
- AI-assisted debugging of failing tests
- AI code review for test quality
- Automated test maintenance suggestions

## Notes

- **TestContainers:** Requires Docker to be running
- **Performance Testing:** JMeter setup needed for Lab 4
- **Security Testing:** OWASP ZAP setup needed for Lab 5
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions workflows for Lab 6

## Verification Status

⚠️ **Pending Full Validation:**
- Depends on Session 3 completion
- Requires TestContainers setup
- Requires CI/CD platform access
- Requires performance/security testing tools

**Lab Instructions Validated:** ✅ All instructions reviewed and appear complete

## Next Steps

1. Complete or obtain Session 3 e-commerce project
2. Set up TestContainers and Docker
3. Configure CI/CD pipeline
4. Set up testing tools (JMeter, OWASP ZAP)
5. Execute all testing labs
