# Session 2: Using Cursor for Mobile Development - Summary

## ✅ Completed Materials

### 1. **COURSE_PROPOSAL_SESSION2.md**
The formal O'Reilly course proposal updated with:
- **Hybrid workflow approach** - Cursor + Android Studio working together
- Course description emphasizing Composer mode
- 3 learning objectives focused on the dual-tool workflow
- Prerequisites including **Android Studio installation required**
- 8 detailed sections (3 hours total)
- Follow-up resources and practice projects

### 2. **session2-outline.md**
Complete instructor guide with:
- Detailed 3-hour timeline (8 parts + 20 min breaks)
- **Hybrid workflow** consistently throughout
- **Cursor Composer mode** as the primary code generation tool
- Clear switching between tools in every exercise
- Android Studio for running/testing
- Updated success metrics and instructor notes

---

## 🎯 Key Differences from Original Plan

### What Changed:
1. **Hybrid Workflow is Central** - Not Cursor-only development
2. **Android Studio Required** - Not optional, mandatory installation
3. **Composer Mode Focus** - Not Chat/Agent modes primarily
4. **Realistic Expectations** - Acknowledges Cursor's limitations for mobile
5. **Tool Switching** - Clear workflow: Cursor for code → Android Studio for testing

### Why It Works:
- ✅ Leverages strengths of both tools
- ✅ Students keep familiar Android Studio workflow
- ✅ Shows clear AI value-add (speeds up coding)
- ✅ More practical and achievable in 3 hours
- ✅ Based on real-world usage (YouTube video example)

## 🚀 The Workflow Students Will Learn

```
1. Create/Open project in Android Studio
   ↓
2. Open same folder in Cursor
   ↓
3. Use Composer (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+I) with @codebase
   ↓
4. Accept/review generated code
   ↓
5. Switch to Android Studio
   ↓
6. Build and run (test on device/emulator)
   ↓
7. Back to Cursor for next iteration
   ↓
8. Repeat!
```

## 🛠️ Complete App Built During Session

### Task Manager Android App

**Features:**
- ✅ Jetpack Compose UI with Material 3
- ✅ TaskCard and TaskList composables
- ✅ ViewModels with StateFlow
- ✅ Multi-screen navigation (Home → Detail)
- ✅ Room database persistence
- ✅ Hilt dependency injection
- ✅ Comprehensive testing (unit + UI)
- ✅ Dark theme support
- ✅ Accessibility features

**Architecture:**
- MVVM pattern
- Unidirectional data flow
- Repository pattern
- Proper separation of concerns

## 📝 Key Instructor Reminders

### Always:
- Start Composer prompts with `@codebase`
- Show both tools (side-by-side if possible)
- Be explicit: "Now I'm in Cursor..." vs "Now in Android Studio..."
- Run app frequently in Android Studio
- Demonstrate iteration: code → test → refine

### Common Student Confusion:
- Which tool to use when? → **Cursor = code, Android Studio = run/test**
- Why not just use one tool? → Explain strengths of each
- Code not updating? → Accept in Composer, rebuild in Android Studio
- Emulator issues? → Manage in Android Studio, not Cursor

### Time Savers if Behind:
- Skip Hilt (use manual DI)
- Simplify theming
- Reduce Now in Android section
- Homework: advanced features

## 🎓 Success Criteria

### Students Should Leave Able To:
- [ ] Set up hybrid workflow (both tools working together)
- [ ] Use Composer mode with @codebase tag
- [ ] Generate complete Composables and ViewModels
- [ ] Build multi-screen apps with navigation
- [ ] Integrate Room database
- [ ] Write tests with AI assistance
- [ ] Switch efficiently between Cursor and Android Studio
- [ ] Apply workflow to their own projects

### Not Expected:
- ❌ Abandoning Android Studio completely
- ❌ Understanding every line of AI-generated code
- ❌ Building production-ready apps without manual refinement
- ❌ Perfect AI prompts on first try

## 📚 Materials Still Needed

### To Create Next:
1. **slides-session2.md** - Slidev presentation
2. **labs-session2.md** - Hands-on lab exercises
3. **android-studio-cursor-guide.md** - Hybrid workflow guide
4. **session2-starter-project/** - Starter code repository
5. **now-in-android-guide.md** - Exploration guide

### Prerequisites Students Need:
- Session 1 completed (or Cursor basics understood)
- Android Studio installed and configured
- Cursor IDE installed
- Kotlin extensions for Cursor
- Android SDK and emulator/device ready

## 💡 Teaching Philosophy

### This Session Emphasizes:
1. **Practical workflow** over theoretical purity
2. **Tool complementarity** over tool competition
3. **AI acceleration** over AI replacement
4. **Iteration** over perfection
5. **Understanding** over memorization

### Key Message:
> "Cursor won't replace Android Studio, but it will make you write code 5-10x faster. Use each tool for what it's best at."

## 🤔 Acknowledged Limitations

### What the YouTube Video Probably Hid:
- Debugging complexity when AI-generated code fails
- Time spent fixing AI mistakes
- Learning curve for effective prompting
- Build/sync issues between tools
- Compose preview limitations in Cursor
- Real-world app complexity (auth, networking, etc.)

### Our Honest Approach:
- Show when AI makes mistakes
- Demonstrate debugging with Chat mode
- Acknowledge when manual coding is better
- Set realistic expectations
- Focus on boosting productivity, not magic
