## Instructor Notes

### Timing Buffers
- Breaks provide 20 min catch-up time
- Can compress advanced patterns if needed
- Core agent concepts must be completed
- Future patterns can be shortened if running behind

### Common Issues & Solutions
- **MCP complexity:** Start with simple examples, build complexity gradually
- **Agent orchestration confusion:** Use clear examples, emphasize communication
- **Enterprise integration challenges:** Focus on concepts, provide working examples
- **Future patterns overwhelm:** Keep grounded in current capabilities
- **Students confused about agent vs. AI:** Clarify terminology and concepts

### Adaptation Points
- If ahead: Add more advanced agent patterns, explore additional MCP integrations
- If behind: Focus on core agent concepts, simplify orchestration examples
- If questions: Use Chat mode to explore answers together
- If students struggle with concepts: More Chat mode explanations, simpler examples

### Demo Tips
- **Always explain the agent concept** before implementation
- **Show agent communication** - how agents work together
- **Demonstrate real-world value** - practical applications
- **Highlight specialization** - different agents for different tasks
- **Use real examples** - avoid toy problems
- **Show mistakes and recovery** - agents make errors too
- **Emphasize human oversight** - agents assist, humans decide
