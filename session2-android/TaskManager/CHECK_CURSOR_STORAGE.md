# How to Check Cursor's Global Storage

## Main Storage Location

**macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Cursor/User/`

## Key Directories

- **`globalStorage/`** - Global settings and data (shared across all workspaces)
- **`workspaceStorage/`** - Per-workspace data (each workspace has its own folder)
- **`History/`** - File edit history (local file changes)

## Important Files

### Global Storage
- **`globalStorage/state.vscdb`** - SQLite database containing global state
- **`globalStorage/storage.json`** - JSON file with workspace backups and settings

### Workspace Storage
- **`workspaceStorage/{workspace-hash}/state.vscdb`** - Per-workspace SQLite database
- **`workspaceStorage/{workspace-hash}/chatSessions/`** - Chat conversation sessions (if they exist)
- **`workspaceStorage/{workspace-hash}/chatEditingSessions/`** - Chat editing sessions (if they exist)

## Useful Commands

### 1. List all tables in the global database
```bash
sqlite3 ~/Library/Application\ Support/Cursor/User/globalStorage/state.vscdb ".tables"
```

### 2. Find all chat/conversation-related entries
```bash
sqlite3 ~/Library/Application\ Support/Cursor/User/globalStorage/state.vscdb \
  "SELECT key FROM ItemTable WHERE key LIKE '%chat%' OR key LIKE '%conversation%' OR key LIKE '%session%' ORDER BY key;"
```

### 3. Check interactive sessions (conversations)
```bash
sqlite3 ~/Library/Application\ Support/Cursor/User/globalStorage/state.vscdb \
  "SELECT value FROM ItemTable WHERE key = 'interactive.sessions';" | python3 -m json.tool
```

### 4. Find your workspace hash
```bash
# Find workspace storage for a specific project
for ws in ~/Library/Application\ Support/Cursor/User/workspaceStorage/*/workspace.json; do
  if grep -q "YourProjectName" "$ws" 2>/dev/null; then
    echo "Workspace: $ws"
    cat "$ws"
  fi
done
```

### 5. Check workspace-specific chat sessions
```bash
# Replace {workspace-hash} with your actual workspace hash
ls -la ~/Library/Application\ Support/Cursor/User/workspaceStorage/{workspace-hash}/chatSessions/
```

### 6. View all entries in global storage (be careful, this is large)
```bash
sqlite3 ~/Library/Application\ Support/Cursor/User/globalStorage/state.vscdb \
  "SELECT key FROM ItemTable ORDER BY key;" | less
```

### 7. Search for specific workspace data
```bash
sqlite3 ~/Library/Application\ Support/Cursor/User/workspaceStorage/{workspace-hash}/state.vscdb \
  "SELECT key FROM ItemTable WHERE key LIKE '%chat%' OR key LIKE '%session%';"
```

## Notes

- Conversations may be stored in Cursor's cloud/remote storage (not accessible locally)
- Some chat data might be in encrypted format or require Cursor's internal APIs to access
- The `composerChatViewPane` entries suggest chat panels exist, but actual conversation content may be stored elsewhere
- Workspace hashes are unique identifiers generated by Cursor for each workspace/project
