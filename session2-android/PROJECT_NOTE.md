# Session 2: Android Project Implementation Note

## Status: Requires Android Studio

Session 2 validation requires:
- Android Studio installation
- Android SDK and emulator
- Kotlin support
- Ability to build and run Android APKs

Since this validation is being done in a non-Android development environment, the full implementation will require:

1. **Android Studio** to create the project structure
2. **Physical device or emulator** to run tests
3. **Gradle** for building the Android app

## What Can Be Validated Without Android Studio

The lab instructions in `android_labs.md` can be reviewed for:
- ✅ Clarity of instructions
- ✅ Completeness of prompts
- ✅ Logical flow of exercises
- ✅ Technology choices

## Recommended Approach

When validating Session 2, you should:
1. Use Android Studio to create the TaskManagerApp project
2. Use Cursor Composer to generate code as per lab instructions
3. Test in Android Studio/emulator
4. Document findings

## Lab Structure Overview

Session 2 has 7 main labs:
- Lab 0: Setup Verification (Android Studio + Cursor)
- Lab 1: Creating Task Manager Project
- Lab 2: Building Task UI Components (Compose)
- Lab 3: State Management (ViewModel + StateFlow)
- Lab 4: Multi-Screen Navigation
- Lab 5: Room Database Persistence
- Lab 6: Testing ViewModels and UIs
- Lab 7: Hilt DI and Polish

All require full Android development environment.
